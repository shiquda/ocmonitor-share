## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

**Option 1: uv Installation (Fastest - One-liner)**

[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a fast Python package manager. It installs the tool in an isolated environment without cloning the repository.

```bash
# Install directly from GitHub
uv tool install git+https://github.com/Shlomob/ocmonitor-share.git

# With optional extras
uv tool install "git+https://github.com/Shlomob/ocmonitor-share.git#egg=ocmonitor[charts,export]"
```

**Why uv?**
- No need to clone the repository
- Lightning-fast dependency resolution
- Creates isolated environments automatically
- Easy to upgrade: `uv tool upgrade ocmonitor`

**Option 2: pipx Installation (Cross Platform)**

[pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) is the recommended way to install Python CLI applications. It creates isolated environments and works on all platforms (including Arch Linux, Ubuntu, macOS, etc.).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shlomob/ocmonitor-share.git
cd ocmonitor-share
pipx install .
```

**Why pipx?**
- Creates isolated environments (no dependency conflicts)
- Works on Arch Linux without breaking system packages
- No sudo required
- Easy to upgrade or uninstall

**Optional extras:**
```bash
# With visualization charts
pipx install ".[charts]"

# With export functionality  
pipx install ".[export]"

# With all extras
pipx install ".[charts,export]"
```

**Option 3: Automated Installation (Linux/macOS)**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shlomob/ocmonitor-share.git
cd ocmonitor-share
./install.sh
```

**Option 4: Manual Installation**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shlomob/ocmonitor-share.git
cd ocmonitor-share
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Quick configuration check
ocmonitor config show

# Analyze your sessions
ocmonitor sessions ~/.local/share/opencode/storage/message

# Analyze by project
ocmonitor projects ~/.local/share/opencode/storage/message

# Real-time monitoring
ocmonitor live ~/.local/share/opencode/storage/message

# Export your data
ocmonitor export sessions ~/.local/share/opencode/storage/message --format csv
```

### Sessions Summary

[![Sessions Summary Screenshot](screenshots/sessions-summary.png)](screenshots/sessions-summary.png)

*Click image to view full-size screenshot of sessions summary output*

#### Workflow Grouping

By default, sessions are grouped into **workflows** - a main session combined with its sub-agent sessions (like `explore`). This gives you a complete picture of your coding session including all agent activity.

```bash
# Sessions with workflow grouping (default)
ocmonitor sessions ~/.local/share/opencode/storage/message

# Sessions without grouping (flat list)
ocmonitor sessions ~/.local/share/opencode/storage/message --no-group

# List detected agents and their types
ocmonitor agents
```

**Workflow Features:**
- Main sessions and sub-agent sessions are visually grouped with tree-style formatting
- Aggregated tokens and costs are shown for the entire workflow
- Sub-agent count displayed in the Agent column (e.g., `+2` means 2 sub-agents)
- Use `--no-group` to see individual sessions without grouping

### Time-Based Reporting

#### `ocmonitor daily|weekly|monthly <path> [--breakdown]`

Time-based usage breakdown with optional per-model cost analysis.

```bash
# Daily breakdown
ocmonitor daily ~/.local/share/opencode/storage/message

# Weekly breakdown with per-model breakdown
ocmonitor weekly ~/.local/share/opencode/storage/message --breakdown

# Monthly breakdown
ocmonitor monthly ~/.local/share/opencode/storage/message

# Weekly with custom start day
ocmonitor weekly ~/.local/share/opencode/storage/message --start-day friday --breakdown
```

**`--breakdown` Flag:** Shows token consumption and cost per model within each time period (daily/weekly/monthly), making it easy to see which models are consuming resources.

Supported days: `monday`, `tuesday`, `wednesday`, `thursday`, `friday`, `saturday`, `sunday`

### Live Monitoring Commands

#### `ocmonitor live <path>`

Real-time monitoring dashboard that updates automatically.

```bash
# Start live monitoring (updates every 5 seconds)
ocmonitor live ~/.local/share/opencode/storage/message

# Custom refresh interval (in seconds)
ocmonitor live ~/.local/share/opencode/storage/message --refresh 10
```

**Features:**
- 🔄 Auto-refreshing display with professional UI design
- 📊 Real-time cost tracking with progress indicators
- ⏱️ Live session duration with 5-hour progress bar
- 📈 Token usage updates and context window monitoring
- 🚀 **Output Rate** - Rolling 5-minute window showing output tokens per second
- 🚦 Color-coded status indicators and time alerts
- 📂 Project name display for better context
- 📝 Human-readable session titles instead of cryptic IDs
- 🔗 **Workflow Tracking** - Automatically tracks entire workflow including sub-agents (explore, etc.)

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Configuration File Location

Create your configuration file at: **`~/.config/ocmonitor/config.toml`**

```bash
# Create the configuration directory
mkdir -p ~/.config/ocmonitor

# Create your configuration file
touch ~/.config/ocmonitor/config.toml
```

### Configuration Options

The tool is highly configurable through the `config.toml` file:

```toml
[paths]
messages_dir = "~/.local/share/opencode/storage/message"
export_dir = "./exports"

[ui]
table_style = "rich"
progress_bars = true
colors = true

[export]
default_format = "csv"
include_metadata = true
```

**Configuration File Search Order:**
1. `~/.config/ocmonitor/config.toml` (recommended user location)
2. `config.toml` (current directory)
3. Project directory fallback

## 🛠️ Development

### Prerequisites

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shlomob/ocmonitor-share.git
cd ocmonitor-share

# Using pip (editable install)
python3 -m pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Or using pipx (editable install)
pipx install -e ".[dev]"
```

**Install all extras for development:**
```bash
python3 -m pip install -e ".[dev,charts,export]"
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run only unit tests
pytest -m unit

# Run only integration tests
pytest -m integration

# Legacy test scripts
python3 test_basic.py
python3 test_simple.py
```
